    <button>+ How does the GPA Report work?</button>
    <div>
      <p>
        Our GPA Report feature generates a Customizable GPA Report
        using your GPA information. You can customize what information
        is shown on your GPA Report by selecting what you want from
        the 5 checkboxes. A GPA Report with all of the options
        selected would show your cumulative GPA, weighted GPA,
        unweighted GPA, total GPA, and course details. After you have
        customized what information you want to see on the GPA Report
        you can give the file a name and an extension. The file name
        cannot be an empty string, otherwise, an auto-generated name
        is given to the file. The GPA Report automatically downloads
        as a TXT file; however, if you want to download the GPA Report
        as another file type, then you can change the File Extension
        box. For example, if you want to download the GPA Report as a
        Microsoft Word document instead of a normal text file, then
        you can input "docx" into the File Extension box. Once you're
        done with all of that, you can click the red button to
        download your GPA Report.
      </p>

        Here is an example of what a GPA Report with all of the

      + What affect do AP and Honors courses have on my GPA?
    </button>
    <div>
      <p>
        AP and Honors courses do not impact your Unweighted GPA,
        however they are very important for calculating Weighted GPA.
        AP and Honors courses both add "weight" to your points. What
        this means is that AP and Honors courses add "extra" points in
        addition to the points you have already earned for the course.
        Typically, Honors courses have a weight of +0.5 (meaning 0.5
        extra points are added to the amount of points earned for that
        course) and AP courses have a weight of +1.0. This is the
        weight that this calculator uses, however this may vary from
        school to school. Some schools do not give the weighted points
        if you fail the class, meaning a D or below. Talk to your
        school to understand your school's specific grading scale in
        terms of AP and Honors classes.

      + How can I calculate my total GPA (using cumulative GPA)?
    </button>
    <div>
      <p>
        Calculating you total GPA using cumulative GPA is very similar
        to calculating your semeseter GPA.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Get your cumulative GPA and the amount of credits you have
          earned so far before the semester. If you are having trouble
          finding this, your transcipt is a good place to look.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the same process from calculating your semester GPA to
          list out your total points & total credits earned for the
          semester.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add your cumulative GPA with your total points, then add all
          your credits earned before the semester with the ones you
          earned for the semester.
        </li>
        <li>
          Divide the sum of your cumulative GPA and the total points

  <div *ngIf="faq4" class="entry-content">
    <button>+ Should I take a lot of AP and Honors courses?</button>
    <div>
      <p>
        This decision really depends on your needs. AP & Honors
        courses are often more difficult and have a lot more course
        load than normal courses, so if you have many extracurricular
        commitments or you have not performed well in that certain
        subject previously, take these into consideration when
        thinking about taking these courses. You should also consider
        if you have interest in or if you have performed well in that
        certain subject. Talking to your teacher about this is
        essential as they probably know your skills the best and can
        predict how you would perform in a college-like course.
        Colleges want to see you work hard and succeed, which some
        students show by taking AP & Honors courses and some students
        may not need AP & Honors courses to show this.

    </button>
    <div>
      <p>
        Taking AP & Honors classes and having a good GPA are both very
        important. Colleges want to see you work hard and succeed by
        taking AP & Honors classes, however, if you are earning C's in
        these classes, it shows that you are not ready for those
        challenging classes. However, if you are earning A's or B's in
        Honors or AP classes, this is generally more favorable than
        earning A's in less-challenging courses. It really depends on
        if the course is suitable for you.

    <button>+ What is considered a good GPA?</button>
    <div>
      <p>
        This question is a bit subjective, as it really depends on
        your goals for high school. High schoolers should aim for a
        GPA of 3.3 or higher especially if you are interested in
        attending top-tier colleges like the Ivy League, since a lot
        those schools consider 3.3 as a minimum. If you want to
        challenge yourself or aim for Valedictorian, try going for a
        GPA of 4.0 or even higher(if your school uses a weighted GPA
        scale)!

  <div *ngIf="faq7" class="entry-content">
    <button>+ What is the highest high school GPA possible?</button>
    <div>
      <p>
        If your school uses an unweighted GPA system, then the highest
        possible GPA is 4.0. If your school uses a weighted GPA
        system, it's possible to even reach a GPA of 5.0, however it's
        highly unlikely.

  <div *ngIf="faq8" class="entry-content">
    <button>+ Is high school GPA important for college?</button>
    <div>
      <p>
        High school GPA is probably one of the most important factors
        for college admissions. Many colleges have a minimun GPA
        requirement for admission. The importance of GPA to colleges
        varies from college to college. Some may emphasize GPA a lot
        while others may value other factors more. It is best you
        research individual colleges to understand their admission
        critieria to get a better understanding of this.

      + If I have a low GPA, does that mean I cannot go to a good

    </button>
    <div>
      <p>
        A low GPA does present some pretty significant challenges for
        college admissions, however, that doesn't mean you have no
        chance of making it into a good college anymore. Colleges
        consider many factors when review applications including
        extracurriculat activities, essays, recommendation letters,
        and standardized test scores. However, a low GPA still does
        present some significant challenges, so you should still try
        to get a better GPA.
